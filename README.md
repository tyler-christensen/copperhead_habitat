Copperhead tracking data

Data from copperhead radio telemetry (2016 - 2019). Data include identifiers (season, individual, sex, and reproductive status), measured habitat values at tracked snake locations, and extracted individual- and population-level utilization distribution values (both probability density values and isopleth/volume contour values [%]). Coordinates are excluded to protect sensitive location information in accordance with New Jersey Fish and Wildlife Scientific Collecting Permit conditions.

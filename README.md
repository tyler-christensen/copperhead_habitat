Appendix A: Supplementary Analyses. Analyses include: (1) comparison of results of home range estimators; (2) evaluation of the effect of sample size on minimum convex polygon home range estimates; (3) spatial covariance of habitat covariates; (4) results of GLM and GLMM describing spatial habitat use when spatial covariance structure is considered; (5) Principal component variable loadings for individual core habitats; (6) Tukey-Kramer post-hoc pairwise PCA score comparison of individual core habitats grouped by reproductive class.

Appendix B: Data from copperhead radio telemetry (2016 - 2019). Data include identifiers (season, individual, sex, and reproductive status), measured habitat values at tracked snake locations, and extracted individual- and population-level utilization distribution values (both probability density values and isopleth/volume contour values [%]). Coordinates are excluded to protect sensitive location information in accordance with New Jersey Fish and Wildlife Scientific Collecting Permit conditions.
